# Methods Folder

The `methods` folder contains utility functions and helpers for querying and updating the application store, as well as interacting with core dApp logic such as account, network, transactions, and app initialization. These methods provide a framework-agnostic way to access and manipulate dApp state, making them suitable for use in any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

For detailed documentation on each set of methods, refer to the corresponding markdown files in the subfolders:

- [Account Methods](./account/ACCOUNT_METHODS_README.md)
- [App Initialization](./initApp/INIT_APP_README.md)
- [Login Info Methods](./loginInfo/LOGIN_INFO_README.md)
- [Network Methods](./network/NETWORK_METHODS_README.md)
- [Transactions Methods](./transactions/TRANSACTIONS_METHODS_README.md)
- [Track Transactions](./trackTransactions/README.md) *(if available)*

Each subfolder contains its own README with more specific usage and examples.
